        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            From January to December 2023, I worked as a UX/UI designer at Retail Business Services, an Ahold Delhaize USA company that provides IT services to grocery retailers that include Food Lion, Giant Food, The GIANT Company, Hannaford, and Stop & Shop. Under the cooperative learning assignment, I was placed on the team working on mobile applications for retail associates with a senior designer. 
            <b>
            The focus for our team was to modernize a suite of legacy applications in preparation for sunsetting outdated technology that was no longer supported. 
            </b>
            This case study contains a summary of the most impactful work I contributed to the team. The content provided for each project has been left intentionally vague, so as not to breach non-disclosure agreements.

                        Computer Aided Ordering software with outdated hardware and user interface design was identified to be difficult to use and time-consuming to train up new employees. The lack of documentation and subject matter experts for the information architecture of the software presented a challenge for future modernization efforts. The legacy software comprised multiple systems, and was to be ported to modern mobile devices due to discontinued support on legacy devices.

However, existing design files were found to be difficult to utilize and information architecture was absent, leading to confusion amongst team members. These circumstances lead to rework and bug fixes.

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
            During my one-year cooperative learning experience, I had the opportunity to develop my UX research skills through interviews and contextual inquiries. I learned about the importance of information architecture while working on legacy applications, and was able to contribute to a design system that needed to adhere to brand and technical requirements. In addition, I practiced my communication and time management skills through working on multiple presentations and projects with a team.
