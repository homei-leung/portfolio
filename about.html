                <h6>Web Developer and UX/UI Designer</h6>
                <p>
                    HoMei is a UX/UI designer and web developer with a background in materials engineering who is equal parts logic and creativity. She is motivated by problem-solving technologies that make life more enjoyable, dedicated to making a positive impact, and strives for continuous improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the concepts of Design Thinking and accessibility, she left her materials engineering job in 2022 to pursue User Interface Design full-time at CareerFoundry. After completing the program, she landed her first design role at Ahold Delhaize USA, where she supported the modernization of legacy applications used in the retail grocery space. Working with developers at ADUSA motivated her to learn more about software development and how to translate designs to code, making ideas into reality.
