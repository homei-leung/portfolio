        <h2>Situation</h2>
        <p>
            Existing recipe apps lack visual content for in-process cooking steps, or include too much extraneous content that take focus away from the recipes. Some also have poor searchability and do not provide a quick unit conversion between metric and imperial measurements.

        <p>
            Research, strategize, and design a responsive web app to provide step-by-step video, audio, and text instruction for a seamless learning experience. Add time-saving funcitonalities relevant to the full cooking experience.

            <p>
                Once the functionalities were determined, the layout of each screen was built using a grid system. Design principles and patterns, such as gathering user input, navigation, and feedback were applied. The screens were iterated to refine hierarchy and ensure UI elements were placed appropriately for a mobile platform. The home screen in particular went through several revisions.
            </p>
            <p>Takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users want diverse recipes without viewing duplicate results
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users like clean interfaces without too many distractions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users want to be able to mark ingredients they already have for their recipes

                    Low-fidelity wireframes were drawn for each user flow using the Crazy 8's method to proiduce a variety of screens. The final wireframes were prototyped in marvel for user testing. Major discoveries from testing included that users found the search submission unintuitive and that they wanted to use the hamburger menu to access profile settings.

                    When looking for a recipe on Mini Chef, users can search ingredients they already have at home, or try something new by selecting a recipe on the front page. Once a recipe has been selected, the yield can be adjusted in the ingredients list. Users can also share their favorite recipes with friends and family from the recipe page.

                    On the recipe page, users can follow along in three ways: watching a video, listening to the instructions, or reading along. Each step can be played on loop until the user is ready to move on.
